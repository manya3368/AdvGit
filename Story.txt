Once, there was a boy who became bored when he watched over the village sheep grazing on the hillside. 
To entertain himself, he sang out, 
“Wolf! Wolf! The wolf is chasing the sheep!”

As they saw there was no wolf, they said strictly, “Save your frightened cry for when there really is a wolf! Don’t cry ‘wolf’ when there is no wolf!” 
But the boy grinned at their words while they walked grumbling down the hill once more.
